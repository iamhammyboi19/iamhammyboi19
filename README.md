#### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ahmed - a Full Stack Software Engineer with a Systems Focus

I hold a BSc in Computer Engineering from Near East University, Nicosia, TRNC. I specialize in low-level C++ systems programming, with hands-on experience building high-performance network applications using multi-threaded I/O, `kqueue`, and `epoll`. One of my key projects includes developing a Custom File Transfer Protocol from scratch - a deep dive into operating system-level socket handling and performance tuning.

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my expertise in **Machine Learning** and **Edge AI**, building a solid mathematical and engineering foundation to support future research in intelligent systems.

ðŸ”§ Passionate about system internals, efficient computing, and pushing the limits of software performance.
